# My First Startpage:

Built as a way to play with some new-to-me JS concepts; API calls, basic dark/light theme with localStorage, basic clock function. More features will be added over time as a learning tool.

## Links:

 - Youtube
 - Github
 - Current Weather Widget (Powered by OpenWeatherMaps API)
 - Facebook (going to be replaced as soon as I find a better icon)
 - Netflix
 - Reddit
 - Mountain Conditions Widget*
 - Udemy
 - Current Temperature Widget (Powered by OpenWeatherMaps API)

## To-Dos

 - Use .localStorage() to save user settings
 - Allow browser location to update API call
 - ~~Add Search Bar Underneath Clock~~
	- ~~Add switch between Google and DuckDuckGo~~
	- ~~Make radio switch direct to Google and DuckDuckGo respectively, using text input as query string~~
 - ~~Fix Clock display while minutes < 10~~
 - Current Weather Widget
 	- ~~Add hover description of current weather on mouseover of weather icon~~
	- ~~Customise weather description css~~ (Not possiple using <span>, maybe create custom element?)
	- Add error icon when no internet access
 - Current Temperature Widget
	- ~~Use OpenWeatherMaps API to display current temperature~~
	- ~~Hover over Current Temperature Widget to Display Daily Min/Max~~
	- Click Current Temperature Widget to swap between celcius and fahrenheit 
 - Mountain Conditions Widget*
	- Could probably be a whole app itself. Click Icon to display snow conditions from Dec to Apr, or bike trail conditions from Apr to Dec
	- Could use AvalancheCanada's API for forecasting (https://avalanche-canada.github.io/AvCan-Services/)
	- Use OpenWeatherMaps API for last 5 days to build general expected trail conditions of bike trails
